# Integrated-Smart-Traffic-Management-System

This Arduino sketch implements a two-road traffic FSM with a safe pedestrian override and IR violation detection. The traffic phases are MAIN_GO, MAIN_WARN, and MAIN_STOP, each lasting PHASE_TIME; an extra PED_MODE forces both roads to red for PED_TIME when a pedestrian long-press is detected. The pedestrian button is read with hardware INPUT_PULLUP and handled via a debounced long-press routine: the code timestamps edge events, confirms stability past BTN_DEBOUNCE, and requires a continuous press ≥ PRESS_TIME before entering pedestrian mode. IR detection is similarly debounced (IR_HOLD_TIME) and only triggers enforcement when the main road is red or yellow. A violation calls triggerViolation(), which enables the buzzer and a camera trigger pin for BUZZER_TIME; both auto-turn off after the interval. Phase transitions are non-blocking and based on millis(), so the loop continually services button, IR, and buzzer timers without delay(). The dummy camera XCLK is generated by configuring Timer2 in CTC mode and toggling D12 inside the ISR. The design emphasizes robustness (debounce, one-shot gating via irHandled), clear serial debugging, and safe handover between normal cycling and pedestrian or enforcement modes.
